[2025-12-28 20:12] Complete Korean Translation Update for All UI Components
File: devlog/2512282012.txt

== What we worked on ==
- Comprehensive i18n update to ensure all UI components have Korean translations
- Identified and translated all hardcoded English strings across the application
- Added new translation sections for components that were missing i18n support

== Changes made ==
- src/lib/i18n/types.ts:
  - Added 70+ new translation keys
  - New sections: searchWeights, fileFilter, export
  - Extended: dashboard (8 keys), search (15 keys), videoDetails (24 keys)

- src/lib/i18n/translations.ts:
  - Added English translations for all new keys
  - Added Korean translations for all new keys
  - Total file now contains 620+ lines of translations

- src/app/search/page.tsx:
  - Translated: subtitle, results header, empty states, match percentage
  - Translated: video player title, scene selection prompt
  - Translated: visual description, transcript, entities, actions, tags labels

- src/app/dashboard/page.tsx:
  - Translated: stats cards (Total Videos, Ready, Processing, Pending)
  - Translated: video count label, upload first video button
  - Translated: processing started/failed notification messages

- src/app/videos/[id]/page.tsx:
  - Translated: view mode toggle (Details, Transcript View)
  - Translated: stat cards (Frame Rate), recording info section
  - Translated: Location, Camera, Recorded, Settings labels
  - Translated: Video Summary, Transcript sections with expand/collapse
  - Translated: All Tags, Clear filter, Scene-by-Scene Breakdown
  - Translated: Transcript Segments, No transcript, Export to Short
  - Translated: Video Player section in transcript view

- src/components/SearchWeightControls.tsx:
  - Added useLanguage hook
  - Translated: title, loading state, presets label
  - Translated: status messages (saved, reset, custom active)
  - Translated: checkbox label, Reset/Save buttons
  - Translated: toast hint message

- src/components/FileToggleBar.tsx:
  - Added useLanguage hook

  - Added useLanguage hook
  - Translated: modal title, scene duration label
  - Translated: aspect ratio options (Center Crop, Letterbox)
  - Translated: quality dropdown options
  - Translated: status badges (Queued, Processing, Ready, Failed)
  - Translated: download section labels (Size, Resolution, Expires)
  - Translated: error messages, footer buttons (Cancel, Export, Close)

== Problems encountered ==
- None significant. The existing i18n infrastructure was well-designed
  and made it straightforward to add new translation keys.

== How we solved it / Current status ==
- Systematic approach:
  1. Explored codebase to understand i18n setup (custom React Context solution)
  2. Scanned all TSX files to identify hardcoded strings
  3. Updated types.ts with new translation key interfaces
  4. Added English translations first, then Korean
  5. Updated each component to import useLanguage and use t.* keys
  6. Verified build passes with `npm run build`

- Build status: SUCCESS
- All components now properly use the translation system

== Key Korean translations added ==
- 검색 가중치 (Search Weights)
- 파일별 필터 (Filter by File)
- 유튜브 쇼츠로 내보내기 (Export to YouTube Short)
- 장면별 분석 (Scene-by-Scene Breakdown)
- 전사 세그먼트 (Transcript Segments)
- 녹화 정보 (Recording Information)
- 비디오 요약 (Video Summary)
- 비디오 처리가 시작되었습니다! (Video processing started!)
- 저장된 기본값 사용 (Use my saved defaults)
- 기본값으로 저장 (Save as default)

== Next steps / TODOs ==
- Consider adding translations for admin page if needed for non-English admins
- Monitor for any new UI strings added in future features
- Consider adding more languages beyond en/ko if user base expands
