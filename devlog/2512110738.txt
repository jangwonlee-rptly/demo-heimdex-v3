[2025-12-11 07:38] Fixed Transcript panel header overlap issue
File: devlog/2512110738.txt

== What we worked on ==
- Fixed a layout bug in the video transcript view where the "Transcript Segments"
  title was overlapping with scene cards during scrolling.
- Refactored the Transcript panel to properly separate the header and scrollable
  content areas.

== Changes made ==
- services/frontend/src/app/videos/[id]/page.tsx (lines 649-726):
  - Refactored Transcript panel from a single scrollable container to a
    flex-column layout with distinct header and content regions.
  - Parent container: Changed from `overflow-y-auto` to `flex flex-col` with
    fixed height `h-[calc(100vh-280px)]`.
  - Header: Added non-scrolling header with `flex-shrink-0` and visual separator
    (border-bottom).
  - Content area: Made scrollable with `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` to take remaining
    vertical space.
  - Removed sticky positioning approach that was causing overlap.

== Problems encountered ==
- Problem 1: Initial implementation used `position: sticky` with `z-index: 10`
  on the title, but this caused the title to visually overlap scene cards as
  they scrolled behind it.
- Problem 2: User wanted the title to stay visible but cards should scroll in
  the space BELOW the title, with no visual overlap - treating them as two
  distinct vertical regions.

== How we tried to solve it ==
- Attempt 1: Added `z-10` to the sticky title to ensure it appeared above scene
  cards. This made the title stay on top but didn't solve the fundamental issue -
  cards were still scrolling behind/underneath the title.
- Analysis: Realized the root issue was architectural - using `position: sticky`
  within a single scroll container means the sticky element overlays the scrolling
  content rather than reserving vertical space.

== How we solved it ==
- Root cause: The original implementation had the header inside the scroll
  container with sticky positioning, which creates an overlay effect rather than
  reserving dedicated vertical space.

- Solution: Refactored to a proper flex-column layout with two distinct regions:
  1. Non-scrolling header region (flex-shrink-0)
  2. Scrollable content region (flex-1 with overflow-y-auto)

- Key changes:
  - Parent div: `flex flex-col h-[calc(100vh-280px)]` - fixed height flex container
  - Header div: `flex-shrink-0 pb-4 border-b` - takes only needed space, doesn't scroll
  - Content div: `flex-1 overflow-y-auto pt-4` - takes remaining space, scrolls independently

- Result: The header and content are now in separate layout regions. The header
  stays fixed at the top, and only the content area scrolls. No overlap possible
  since they occupy different vertical space.

== Next steps / TODOs ==
- Test the fix in the browser to verify scrolling behavior works as expected
- Verify that keyboard/mouse scrolling only affects the content area
- Check that the first card is fully visible below the header without clipping
