[2025-12-09 13:48] Dashboard Video Card Grid Redesign
File: devlog/2512091348.txt

== What we worked on ==
- Redesigned the dashboard video display from a horizontal list format to a card grid layout
- Each video is now displayed as a card with thumbnail on top and metadata below
- Added hover effects and interactive play button overlays
- Implemented responsive grid that adapts to screen size

== Changes made ==
- services/frontend/src/components/VideoCard.tsx: New component created
  - Displays video thumbnail with 16:9 aspect ratio
  - Duration badge overlay (formats as "1:30" for minutes or "45s" for seconds)
  - Status badge (PENDING, PROCESSING, READY, FAILED) with color coding
  - Metadata row: resolution (720p, 1080p, etc.) and upload date
  - Processing spinner overlay for videos being processed
  - Hover overlay with play/view button for ready videos
  - Action buttons: Start Processing, View Details, Reprocess

- services/frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx: Updated
  - Removed inline video list rendering
  - Removed getStatusBadge function (moved to VideoCard)
  - Added handleViewVideo helper function
  - Replaced space-y-4 list with video-card-grid
  - Now uses VideoCard component with onProcess, onView, onReprocess callbacks

- services/frontend/src/app/globals.css: Added new styles
  - .video-card-grid: Responsive grid with auto-fill columns
    - Mobile: minmax(280px, 1fr)
    - Tablet (640px+): minmax(300px, 1fr)
    - Desktop (1024px+): minmax(320px, 1fr)
  - .video-card: Card container with gradient background, border, animations
  - .video-card-thumbnail: 16:9 aspect ratio container with zoom on hover
  - .video-card-duration: Positioned badge with backdrop blur
  - .video-card-processing-overlay: Semi-transparent overlay with spinner
  - .video-card-hover-overlay: Fade-in overlay with play button
  - .video-card-play-btn: Circular cyan button with scale animation
  - .video-card-content, .video-card-title, .video-card-meta, etc.

== Problems encountered ==
- Previous horizontal list layout didn't showcase video thumbnails prominently
- Users had to scan through text-heavy rows to find videos
- Thumbnails were small (160x96px) making it hard to identify videos at a glance

== How we solved it ==
- Implemented a card-based grid layout similar to YouTube/Netflix video libraries
- Thumbnails now take up the full card width with 16:9 aspect ratio
- Duration badge appears as overlay on thumbnail (like YouTube)
- Hover effects provide visual feedback and quick access to view action
- Metadata is condensed but still shows key info: resolution, date, status
- Responsive grid automatically adjusts number of columns based on viewport

== Visual Design Details ==
- Card background: Gradient from rgba(30,41,59,0.5) to rgba(15,23,42,0.7)
- Hover state: Card lifts 4px, cyan border glow, thumbnail zooms 5%
- Play button: Cyan (#06b6d4) circular button with shadow, scales on hover
- Duration badge: Dark semi-transparent background with backdrop blur
- Consistent with existing dark cinematic theme

== Next steps / TODOs ==
- Consider adding video summary preview on hover or in card
- Could add "Recently Added" or "Processing" filter tabs
- May want to add sorting options (by date, duration, status)
- Consider infinite scroll or pagination for users with many videos
